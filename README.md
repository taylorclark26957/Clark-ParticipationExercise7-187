The "SodNotZod" Program allows users to open the file of their choice. After they open the file, they are then prompted to enter the Search ID of the item they wish to purchase. If no errors are made, the user is then prompted to enter the quantity of items they wish to purchase. The user is then displayed the "Discount Menu" and collects the user's Discount Menu selection. After all prompts are finished and have no "wrong" input, the program then displays to the user the "Item Receipt" and the "Final Report". As orders are written, the records (and fields) are written to the MASTER FILE (MasterOrderFile.dat).
